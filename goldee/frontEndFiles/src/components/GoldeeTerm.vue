      Overview
Goldee is not a corporation, nonprofit, or even a business. It’s an idea-- an idea born out of an experience of community members working together to make a positive impact. We all know of the corruption, degradation and inexcusable exploitation in our world today. Goldee believes there’s a better way to make the world go ’round.

Goldee connects people and communities so they can share their services, skills, resources, and friendship. This is not a place of commerce, so do not try to sell your stuff here, please.

Goldee members believe the following:
You have the power to make a difference in your community and world.
The most valuable currency is your positive effect on others.
The Golden Rule is the simplest way to govern our interactions: Do unto others as you want done unto you.
It’s possible for every human to self actualize, but only if their need for food, water, shelter, safety, belonging, and are esteem met; this will only be achieved when we distribute our abundance of resources to those in need.
Always operate with honesty, integrity, transparency and goodwill.

That being said, there are some more things you need to know before you (or the entity that you represent) access or otherwise interact with our servers, services, websites, or any associated content/postings (together, “Goldee”), so please read this carefully, as anytime you interact with Goldee, you agree to these Terms of Use (“Goldee’s Terms”) (last updated March 3, 2018).
Participation
Any participation with Goldee constitutes that you accept Goldee’s Terms and are of legal age (18 years old) and sufficient capacity to accept Goldee’s Terms.

We may change Goldee’s Terms at any time in our sole discretion. If major changes are made, we intend on sending you an email notification, but emails often don’t get read, therefore it is your responsibility to periodically check for changes to Goldee’s Terms. If you don’t agree with Goldee’s Terms, then you are not authorized to use Goldee.
Privacy
Your privacy is important.  Goldee will not intentionally share your private information with other parties (i.e selling data to advertisers). Furthermore, we take security measures to protect against unauthorized access or alteration of your personal information. Goldee uses a AWS server to encrypt and secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure with a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.

However, it’s important that you are aware that no data transmission on the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, by agreeing to Goldee’s Terms, you acknowledge that there are security and privacy limitations inherent to the internet that are simply beyond our control and thus no data between you and this site can ever be guaranteed.

In addition, we want you to be aware of the following:

We collect and store data to improve our service and your experience. This includes: your location or address (whichever you provide us), profile and account information, login times and session lengths, clicks, and messages sent through the site, your IP address, browser type, and referring website address. Goldee does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of eighteen. We do not share this data with third-parties.
We use cookies, yum! Cookies help personalize your online experience and save you time by remembering information you have entered on previous visits to the site. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies are very common. They cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually personalize your browser to decline cookies if for some reason you wanted that.
You can use a third-party account to access your account. Goldee provides users with the ability to connect to their account through third-party accounts (i.e “Login with Facebook”). By connecting your Goldee account to a third-party account, you acknowledge and agree that you are consenting to the continuous release of your information to this third-party site in accordance with your privacy settings on the third-party site. If you do not want information about you to be shared in this manner, do not use this feature. We cannot control what third parties do with your data if you choose to connect your account to them. You may disconnect your account from a third party account at any time.
Goldee will email you. From time to time, Goldee may contact you via email for the purpose of providing announcements, promotional offers, alerts, confirmations, verifications, surveys, and other general communication. In order to improve our services, we track how often these emails are opened and what links are clicked within them. We understand no one likes spam and we strive to be respectful and only email you when it’s important. If you would like to stop receiving emails, you may opt out of communication anytime by replying “unsubscribe” to the email.
Goldee contains links to other sites. This should be obvious, but just to be clear: we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of other sites.
Safety
Most people are well intentioned, and the the vast majority of human-human interactions are safe. However, there are some people in the world that want to do harm, so it’s important to always proceed with caution when interacting with strangers.

We want you to be safe when using Goldee. Unfortunately, Goldee cannot guarantee your wellbeing. Your personal safety is always your responsibility.

Here are some tips that can help you stay safe when meeting people you found online:

Google the person you’re meeting. It’s easy to do and never hurts to verify information you know about the person or see if you find something fishy.
Keep your address private. Goldee does not share your location or address information with other users. It’s used to filter results based on proximity. No one knows exactly where you are unless you tell them.
Meet in a public place. If you’re meeting someone for the first time, insist on a public place such as a coffee shop, library, or busy shopping center and, if possible, bring a friend with you.
Tell someone what you’re doing.  Always let a friend or family member know where you are going and who you are meeting with. Bring a fully charged cell phone in case you run into trouble. Try Circleof6, bSafe, and Ulzi, these apps were designed to provide safety features when meeting with strangers.
Consider getting a Google Voice number. Google Voice is a free service that allows you to select a number that you can give out to people you don’t know. Calls to that number are forwarded to your phone. This provides you with an additional layer of privacy when giving out your number. You can also block numbers, and the caller will receive a “number not in service” message.
Call or video conference with the person ahead of time. Hearing someone’s voice can help you discern if the person is who they say they are.

Trust your instincts. If something just doesn’t feel right about the person you met, chances are you’re on to something.

Goldee is intended to help make the world a better and more connected place. But, we can’t pretend there aren’t bad people in the world. By taking precautions, we can help mitigate the risk involved in meeting new people.

Furthermore, the safety of Goldee is largely dependent on the users of Goldee. Therefore in order to use Goldee you (and all other users) must agree to:

Be good. Never post content that is purposely misleading, false, hateful, threatening, pornographic, or incites violence. Never use Goldee to do or post anything unlawful, misleading, malicious, or discriminatory. Never use Goldee to stalk, troll, bully, intimidate, or harass any user. Do not use Goldee in any way that violates someone else’s rights. Never abuse Goldee’s reporting system.
No funny business: Never upload viruses, malicious code, or do anything that could impair the proper working or appearance of Goldee.
No stealing: Never collect or copy users' information or content either by using automated means (bots, robots, spiders, or scrapers) or manual means (handcopying).
Real accounts: Never create more than one personal account. Never solicit login information, or access an account belonging to someone else without their explicit permission. Never create an account for anyone other than yourself without explicit permission. Never create a new account without Goldee’s explicit permission if yours has been deleted by Goldee. Never purchase or sell Goldee accounts. Never create a bot account.
No rapists or pediphiles. Do not use Goldee if you are a convicted sex offender.
Be responsible. It is your responsibility to use caution and common sense when interacting with others you meet on Goldee. Read and follow our safety page (GoGoldee.com/safety) for information on protecting yourself.  Please help make Goldee a safe space by reporting any content that violates Goldee’s Terms.
